Options are:\\n        - \"evaluate\": Compute the value of the expression (default)\\n        - \"solve\": Solve an equation or system of equations\\n        - \"derive\": Calculate the derivative of an expression\\n        - \"integrate\": Find the indefinite integral of an expression\\n        - \"limit\": Calculate the limit of an expression at a point\\n        - \"series\": Generate a series expansion of an expression\\n        - \"matrix\": Perform matrix operations\\n    precision: Number of decimal places for the result (default: 10).\\n        Higher values provide more precise output but may impact performance.\\n    scientific: Whether to use scientific notation for numbers (default: False).\\n        When True, formats large and small numbers using scientific notation.\\n    force_numeric: Force numeric evaluation of symbolic expressions (default: False).\\n        When True, tries to convert symbolic results to numeric values.\\n    variables: Optional dictionary of variable names and their values to substitute\\n        in the expression, e.g., {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}.\\n    wrt: Variable to differentiate or integrate with respect to (required for\\n        \"derive\" and \"integrate\" modes).\\n    point: Point at which to evaluate a limit (required for \"limit\" mode).\\n        Use \"oo\" for infinity.\\n    order: Order of derivative or series expansion (optional for \"derive\" and\\n        \"series\" modes, default is 1 for derivatives and 5 for series).\\n\\nReturns:\\n    Dict containing status and response content in the format:\\n    {\\n        \"status\": \"success|error\",\\n        \"content\": [{\"text\": \"Result: <calculated_result>\"}]\\n    }\\n\\n    Success case: Returns the calculation result with appropriate formatting\\n    Error case: Returns information about what went wrong during calculation\\n\\nNotes:\\n    - For equation solving, set the expression equal to zero implicitly (x**2 + 1 means x**2 + 1 = 0)\\n    - Use \\'pi\\' and \\'e\\' for mathematical constants\\n    - The \\'wrt\\' parameter is required for differentiation and integration\\n    - Matrix expressions use Python-like syntax: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\\n    - Precision control impacts display only, internal calculations use higher precision\\n    - Symbolic results are returned when possible unless force_numeric=True', 'inputSchema': {'json': {'properties': {'expression': {'description': 'The mathematical expression to evaluate, such as \"2 + 2 * 3\",\\n\"x**2 + 2*x + 1\", or \"sin(pi/2)\".
