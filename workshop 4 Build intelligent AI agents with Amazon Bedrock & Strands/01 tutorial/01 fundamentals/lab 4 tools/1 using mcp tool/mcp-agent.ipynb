    "## Overview\n",
    "The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Strands AI SDK integrates with MCP to extend agent capabilities through external tools and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP enables communication between agents and MCP servers that provide additional tools. The Strands Agent SDK includes built-in support for connecting to MCP servers and using their tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will show you how to use MCP tools on your Strands Agent. We will use the [AWS Documentation MCP server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/) which provides tools to access AWS documentation, search for content, and get recommendations. This MCP server has 3 main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read Documentation**: Fetch and convert AWS documentation pages to markdown format\n",
    "- **Search Documentation**: Search AWS documentation using the official search API\n",
    "- **Recommendations**: Get content recommendations for AWS documentation pages\n",

    "### Connect to MCP server using stdio transport\n",
    "\n",
    "[Transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports) in MCP provide the foundations for communication between clients and servers. It handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received. At the moment there are three standards transport implementations built-in in MCP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Input/Output (stdio)**: enables communication through standard input and output streams. It is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools\n",
    "- **Streamable HTTP**: this replaces the HTTP+SSE transport from previous protocol version. In the Streamable HTTP transport, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests. Server can optionally make use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream multiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich servers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n",
    "- **SSE**: legacy transport for HTTP-based MCP servers that use Server-Sent Events transport  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, you should use stdio for building command-line tools, implementing local integrations and working with shell scripts. You should use Streamable HTTP transports when you need a flexible and efficient way for AI agents to communicate with tools and services, especially when dealing with stateless communication or when minimizing resource usage is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use **custom transports** implementation for your specific needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now connect to the MCP server using stdio transport. First of all, we will use the class `MCPClient` to connect to the [AWS Documentation MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/). This server provides tools to access AWS documentation, search for content, and get recommendations."

      "   - Initialize projects properly with `cdk init app --language [language]`\n",
      "   - Use `cdk synth` to validate constructs before deployment\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Architecture Patterns**\n",
      "   - Use AWS Solutions Constructs for pre-built, vetted patterns\n",
      "   - For GenAI applications, use specialized GenAI CDK Constructs\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security**\n",
      "   - Apply CDK Nag to ensure security best practices\n",
      "   - Follow least privilege principle for IAM roles\n",
      "   - Implement proper encryption and access controls\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Development Workflow**\n",
      "   - Use `cdk synth`, `cdk diff`, and `cdk deploy` regularly\n",
      "   - Implement proper monitoring with Lambda Powertools\n",
      "   - Create Lambda layers for dependencies not in default runtimes\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Core Principles**\n",
      "   - Security first approach\n",
      "   - Cost optimization\n",
      "   - Prefer serverless services when possible\n",
      "   - Define all infrastructure as code\n",
      "   - Consider regional availability for services\n",
