    "## 🧠 Overview: What This Stack Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This AWS CDK stack sets up a **highly available, secure, and scalable cloud infrastructure** to run a containerized application that interacts with **Bedrock**, **DynamoDB**, and a **knowledge base**. It automatically builds and deploys the service using AWS Fargate (a serverless container platform) and exposes it through a load-balanced endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Resources Created and Why They Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ Secure Data Storage (S3 Buckets)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agent Bucket**: Stores internal agent-related data securely. We use this bucket to store agent session data. \n",
    "* **Access Log Bucket**: Collects logs about access to other buckets for auditing and compliance.\n",
    "* **Flow Log Bucket**: Stores logs of network traffic within the system for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "All buckets are encrypted, versioned, and block public access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 Networking (VPC and Flow Logs)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Isolates network traffic to protect your service. It spans **2 Availability Zones** for higher uptime.\n",
    "* **Flow Logs**: Captures all traffic within the VPC and sends it to the Flow Log Bucket, helping with network monitoring and security analysis.\n",
    "* **NAT Gateway**: Allows private resources to securely access the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Compute Platform (ECS Fargate + Cluster)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ECS Cluster**: Hosts the containerized application.\n",
    "* **Fargate Tasks**: These are the compute units that run your Docker container without you needing to manage servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Auto-scaled to run 2 copies** of the application for reliability.\n",
    "  * Deployed in **private subnets**, not directly exposed to the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚢 Container Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docker Image**: Built from a Dockerfile located in your project repo (`../../docker`).\n",
    "* **ARM64 Linux Platform**: Ensures cost-effective and energy-efficient execution.\n",
    "* **Environment Variables**: Includes configuration like logging level and knowledge base ID.\n",
    "* **Logging**: Logs from the application go to a **dedicated CloudWatch Log Group**, retained for 1 week.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 IAM Roles & Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task Execution Role**: Allows the service to pull container images and write logs.\n",
    "* **Task Role**: Grants fine-grained access to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Bedrock API** (to invoke models and retrieve knowledge base content)\n",
    "  * **DynamoDB** (to read/write agent data)\n",
    "  * **SSM Parameter Store** (to retrieve config values)\n",
    "* **Flow Log Role**: Allows VPC to write network logs to S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 Load Balancer (Application Load Balancer)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Publicly accessible** and routes internet traffic to your private containers.\n",
    "* **Health checks** ensure only healthy containers receive traffic.\n",
    "* **Highly available**: spreads across multiple Availability Zones.\n",
    "* **Optional access logs** can be enabled for debugging or analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SSM Parameters**: Securely retrieves the names/IDs of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **knowledge base**\n",
    "  * The **DynamoDB table**\n",
    "* These parameters can be managed outside of the code and updated easily.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📈 Monitoring & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **VPC Flow Logs** for network visibility.\n",
    "* Includes **Nag suppressions** to acknowledge and justify intentional configurations (e.g., public access for ALB, IAM permissions).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Anyone with the ALB DNS name can send requests** to your service (assuming security group and app-level controls allow it).\n",
    "* While this is necessary for public-facing applications, it can pose a **security risk** if not properly protected.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Troubleshooting and debugging\n",
    "* Security auditing\n",
