    "# Building Multi-Agent Systems with Strands Agent Graph\n",
    "Multi-agent systems leverage multiple specialized AI agents working together to solve complex problems through coordinated collaboration. Each agent has specific capabilities and roles, connected through explicit communication pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn to build multi-agent systems using the Strands Agent SDK. We'll progress from basic concepts to advanced implementations, exploring different topologies and real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the three core components of agent graphs (nodes, edges, conditions)\n",
    "- Send targeted messages between specific agents\n",
    "- Monitor and control multi-agent networks\n",
    "- Design specialized agent systems for real-world scenarios\n",

    "## Key Takeaways and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design for acyclicity:** Ensure your graph has no cycles</p>\n",
    "**Use meaningful node IDs:** Choose descriptive names for nodes</p>\n",
    "**Validate graph structure:** The builder will check for cycles and validate entry points</p>\n",
    "**Handle node failures:** Consider how failures in one node affect the overall workflow</p>\n",
    "**Use conditional edges:** For dynamic workflows based on intermediate results</p>\n",
    "**Consider parallelism:** Independent branches can execute concurrently</p>\n",
    "**Nest multi-agent patterns:** Use Swarms within Graphs for complex workflows</p>\n",
    "**Leverage multi-modal inputs:** Use ContentBlocks for rich inputs including images</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now mastered the fundamentals of building multi-agent systems with Strands Agent Graph! You can create sophisticated networks of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to successful multi-agent systems is:\n",
    "- Matching topology to use case\n",
    "- Defining clear agent roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Establishing proper communication patterns\n",
    "- Managing resources and cleanup effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can build increasingly sophisticated systems for real-world applications in research, content creation, decision-making, customer service, and beyond."
