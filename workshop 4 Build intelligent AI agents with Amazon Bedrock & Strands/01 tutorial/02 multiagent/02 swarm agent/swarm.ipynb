    "## Understanding Swarm Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A Swarm is a collaborative agent orchestration system where multiple agents work together as a team to solve complex tasks. Unlike traditional sequential or hierarchical multi-agent systems, a Swarm enables autonomous coordination between agents with shared context and working memory.\n",

    "* **Self-organizing agent teams** with shared working memory\n",
    "* **Tool-based coordination** between agents\n",
    "* **Autonomous agent collaboration** without central control\n",
    "* **Dynamic task distribution** based on agent capabilities\n",
    "* **Collective intelligence** through shared context\n",
    "* **Multi-modal input support** for handling text, images, and other content types\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Swarms Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarms operate on the principle of emergent intelligence - the idea that a group of specialized agents working together can solve problems more effectively than a single agent. Each agent in a Swarm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Has access to the full task context\n",
    "2. Can see the history of which agents have worked on the task\n",
    "3. Can access shared knowledge contributed by other agents\n",
    "4. Can decide when to hand off to another agent with different expertise\n"

    "\n",
    "- For complex tasks requiring diverse expertise and specialized knowledge\n",
    "- When you need multiple perspectives and collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- For tasks that benefit from autonomous agent coordination and collective intelligence\n",

    "- For projects requiring dynamic task distribution based on agent capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create specialized agents**: Define clear roles for each agent in your Swarm\n",
    "2. **Use descriptive agent names**: Names should reflect the agent's specialty\n",
    "3. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Adjust based on task complexity and expected runtime\n",
    "4. **Enable repetitive handoff detection**: Set appropriate values for `repetitive_handoff_detection_window` and `repetitive_handoff_min_unique_agents` to prevent ping-pong behavior\n",
    "5. **Include diverse expertise**: Ensure your Swarm has agents with complementary skills\n",
    "6. **Provide agent descriptions**: Add descriptions to your agents to help other agents understand their capabilities\n",
    "7. **Leverage multi-modal inputs**: Use ContentBlocks for rich inputs including images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent swarms solve complex problems through emergent collective intelligence. The Strands Agents SDK provides both a flexible swarm tool and native Swarm class for creating custom agent teams that collaborate autonomously. By distributing tasks across specialized agents with individual model providers, tools, and configurations, swarms achieve better results than single agents working alone. With built-in coordination tools, shared context, and comprehensive safety mechanisms, developers can create sophisticated multi-agent systems that handle complex, multi-faceted problems through self-organizing collaboration.\n",
